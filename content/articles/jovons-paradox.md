An overlooked consequences of automation and/or optimization is that is will inevitably get abused. This abuse is generally better than the original pain. But none the less, one should consider it when automating and optimizing.

## Example

I once built an email generating tool for a company I was working for. Email builds had become a nightmare. Revisions took hours and each change generally resulted lots of bugs.

The tool I built took a simple json file and generated a flawless email. The predefined template parts were thoroughly tested in advance of use. This meant emails could be built and changed at a fraction of the time it previously took.

Because of the gained efficiency, the number of changes increased. Because it was so painful previously to make changes, more planning was done up front and changes were only made when absolutely necessary. Once the new tool was in place revisions increased dramatically. From an average of one to four.

Once that happened the efficiency gain almost disappeared. Because the time to build reduction was then shifted to time spent on revising. In this example this issue was remedied with simple revision restrictions. But it may not be that simple for all projects.

### Consider Jovons Paradox

When considering the cost and gain from automation and/or optimization it's important to consider Jovons Paradox. It's natural to look at the gains in efficiently. But it's important to consider how those gains could be abused and if it's still worth doing. Sometimes a little pain can have a net gain.
