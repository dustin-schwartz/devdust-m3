Having good processes and policies in place in regard to scaling can save a lot of time and effort in the long run. One such policy is the Beyonce Rule.

## What is The Beyonce Rule?

The rules is "if you like it, you should have put a CI test on it." The clever, and hilarious I might add, name makes it easy to remember. Just because it's funny, doesn't mean it's not true. Ensuring features don't break as your add new features and do upgrades is important. And will only become exponentially more expensive over time if the process is manual. But if you add a CI test for that features, it becomes much cheaper and easier.
